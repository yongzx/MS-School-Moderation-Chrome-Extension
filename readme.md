# Minerva Schools School Moderation Chrome Extension
**Purpose of Creation:** Copying and pasting the school address across tabs are incovenient. This chrome extension reduces the time by copying the address from the search page and pasting it into the columns for address in Minerva Schools School Moderation page with a few clicks of buttons.

### How it works
##### Situation 1

##### Situation 2

### How to install
1. Download the entire 'src' folder. You can rename it after you download it.
2. Open the extension setting in Google Chrome by typing `chrome://extensions/` in the Google Chrome address bar.
3. Click on "Load unpacked extension..." button and open the downloaded (and renamed) folder.
4. The extension should appear on your Google Chrome.

### Current Limitations
1. It is a chrome extension so it only works on Google Chrome.
2. It works for US Schools (I have not tested it on schools from other regions.)
3. It only works in two situations shown in the gifs above: when the school address shows up on the right side of the Google search page, and when the address can be accessed from the columns of multiple schools appearing in Google search page.
